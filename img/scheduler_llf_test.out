Periodic Thread Component Test

This test consists in creating three periodic threads as follows:
- Every 100ms, thread A execs "a", waits for 50ms and then execs another "a";
- Every 80ms, thread B execs "b", waits for 20ms and then execs another "b";
- Every 60ms, thread C execs "c", waits for 10ms and then execs another "c";
Threads will now be created and I'll wait for them to finish...
